	  <h2>What Is TickyBot</h2>
	  <div class="textBox">
	    <p>TickyBot is a Slack Bot that lets you use support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist you users, if you don't feel like it.</p>
	    <p>
	      With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages. 
Image about someone asking silly questions and the workplace admin asking him/her to open a support ticket so other admins could look into the issue.
